  ## Note: It's quite unlikely that an IP should be specific. Normally, the best thing to do is leave it to Kubernetes
  ##       to allocate a free IP from the pool.

  # privateIp:
  ## Only relevant if the `type` above is "LoadBalancer"
  loadBalancer:
    ## If there is already a reserved public IP that this load balancer should use, indicate it here.

## More generally, a "request" can be thought of as "how much is this container expected to need usually". it should be
## possible to burst outside these constraints (during a high load operation). However, Kubernetes may kill the pod
## if the node is under too higher load and the burst is outside its request
##
## Limits are hard limits. Violating them is either impossible, or results in container death. I'm not sure whether
## making these optional is a good idea or not; at the moment, I think I'm happy to defer QOS to the cluster and try
## and keep requests close to usage.
##
## Requests are what are used to determine whether more software "fits" onto the cluster.
