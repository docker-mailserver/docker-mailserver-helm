## More generally, a "request" can be thought of as "how much is this container expected to need usually". it should be
## possible to burst outside these constraints (during a high load operation). However, Kubernetes may kill the pod

##
## Limits are hard limits. Violating them is either impossible, or results in container death. I'm not sure whether
## making these optional is a good idea or not; at the moment, I think I'm happy to defer QOS to the cluster and try
## and keep requests close to usage.

## Requests are what are used to determine whether more software "fits" onto the cluster.
